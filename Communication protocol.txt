Communication protocol:

From app to Arduino: 

Light leaf:
from app to Arduino: "pattern#color" where # is the pattern number. 1 for solid, 2 for flash, and so on.
 
example 1: "pattern1ff0000ff" //Since pattern is 1 then this is solid LEDs
example 2: "pattern3ff0000ff" //Since pattern is 3 then this is breathing LEDs or anything else

enable light leaf:
    from app to Arduino: "enable1" for on 
             and "enable0" for off

Health leaf:

1) SOS:
    from app to Arduino: "SOS1" for on 
             and "SOS0" for off
2) posture:
    from app to Arduino: "posture1" for on 
             and "posture0" for off
============================================================================

From Arduino to app (these messages are sent at any time, so make sure to always listen for them): 

For Battery: 
    from Arduino to app: "battery#" // where # is the number of bars 0 or 1 or 2 or 3 or 4. (4 is 100%, 3 is 75%, and so on)

For Posture: 
    from Arduino to app: "BadPosture"

For SOS: 
    from Arduino to app: "SOS"
