# Team Member Project Milestones and Testing Strategy     

# Septembr   
Hyrum -   
1. Finish making smart shoes by Friday, 9/15   
2. Have parts for prototype smart wardrobe (work with Rolando) by Friday, 9/15   
3. Complete LED leaf/sensor (work with Rolando) by end of Sept   
   
Jessika -  
1. Make custom control function for light leaf/sensor that works with Arduino by Friday, 9/15   
2. Make emergency and health leaf/sensors by end of Sept   
3. Complete initial smart clothing prototype (work with Saoud) by end of Sept    
   
Rolando -  
1. Have parts for prototype smart wardrobe (work with Hyrum) by Friday, 9/15   
2. Complete LED leaf/sensor (work with Hyrum) by end of Sept   
3. Complete Arc Reactor by end of Sept   
   
Saoud -   
1. Complete Arduino programming communication with app by Friday, 9/15   
2. Make schematic of wiring everything to Arduino by Friday, 9/15   
3. Research batteries we can use for smart clothes, how to check battery %, how to charge them by end of Sept
4. Complete initial smart clothing prototype (work with Jess) by end of Sept    

Testing strategy for app functionality (Jess, Saoud)-- To test the app's functionality we will connect the app to the Arduino via BLE and test all our app features to make sure that everything works as expected.   
Initial prototype of smart clothes (Rolando)-- The first working prototype may not have all the features yet, it will probably only have the LED leaf; test it we will use our app to change the LED color (while ensuring nothing explodes or burns).   
Smart shoes prototype testing (Hyrum)-- To test the smart shoes we will simply ensure that it automatically self-ties when it detects someone putting on the shoes.   

   
# October   
Hyrum -   
1. Complete prototype smart wardrobe (work with Rolando) by Friday, 10/14
2. Complete sensor functionality with prototype smart wardrobe (work with Rolando) by end of Oct   
   
Jessika -   
1. Complete emergency and health leaf/sensor app customization (work with Saoud) by Friday, 10/14   
2. Design and begin implementing modular sensor connection on smart clothes (work with Saoud) by end of Oct     

Rolando -   
1. Complete prototype smart wardrobe (work with Hyrum) by Friday, 10/14
2. Complete sensor functionality with prototype smart wardrobe (work with Hyrum) by end of Oct   

Saoud -   
1. Complete testing for the emergency and health leaf/sensors (work with Jess) by Friday, 10/14
2. Design and begin implementing modular sensor connection on smart clothes (work with Saoud) by end of Oct    

Testing strategy for smart wardrobe (Hyrum, Rolando)--- To test it we are going to make sure it's solid enough and safe to use.   
Testing strategy for initial smart clothes prototype (Jessika, Saoud)-- We will test our refined design similarly to our first prototype + adding all other leaves and making sure the app can control all leaves.   
   
   
# November      
Everyone -     
- Finish the smart wardrobe with all the features by the end of Nov   
- Finish the final design for the smart clothing by the end of Nov   
   
Testing strategy for smart wardrobe (everyone)-- We will test our wardrobe by making sure it's safe to use and it can charge and store leaves easily.   
Testing strategy for smart clothes (everyone)-- We will test our final design to make sure all part locations and software are finalized, and that all leaves are easily swappable.   

   
# December      
Everyone -    
- Finish testing and prep for final demo
