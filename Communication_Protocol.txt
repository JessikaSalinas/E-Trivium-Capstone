Communication Protocol Between App & Arduino:   
   
   
-----Messages From App to Arduino-----
   
* Light leaf:
   
1) Color: An 8-digit color code that the light leaf should be changed to.
          E.g.: "FFFFFFFF" is white. "FF0000FF" is blue.
2) Pattern + Color: A 13-digit message with the pattern name (currently only Solid and Flash) and the color code.
          E.g.: "SolidFF0000FF" for solid blue lights. "FlashFFFFFFFF" for flashing white lights.
3) Enable/disable lights: "EnableLights" to enable light leaf, "DisableLights" to disable light leaf.
   
* SOS Leaf:
   
1) SOS: "EnableSOS" to enable SOS leaf, "DisableSOS" to disable SOS leaf.
   
* Health Leaf:
   
1) Posture: "EnablePosture" to enable posture monitoring, "DisablePosture" to disable posture monitoring.
   
2) Pedometer: "ResetSteps" to reset the step counter for the app & Arduino.

-----Mesasges From Arduino to App----- 
(Note: These messages are sent at any time from the app, so Arduino must always be listening for them.)
   
* Battery: "battery#" where # is the battery percentage (75-100% is 4 bars, 50-74% is 3 bars, 25-49% is 2 bars, <25% is 1 bar, 0% is no bars). 
   
* SOS Leaf:
    
1) SOS: "SOS" if the SOS button has been pressed.
   
* Health Leaf:
   
1) Posture: "BadPosture" if the Arduino detects poor posture.
